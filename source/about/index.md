# Who are we:
We are a group of Chinese-speaking engineers who work in the startups and tech giants around the bay area and passionate about technology and career development in tech.
# What's the goal of the Study club:
We are driven to connect, **develop** and screen talents who aim to become Tech Lead, Architect or Tech-savvy Engineer/Product Manager.
# How Long has it been established:
The original founding members have been gathering since the start of 2019 and formally established this Non-profit Organization in Oct, 2019.
# What does the event/meetup work:
It's more like a hardcore and intensive discussion panel focussing on system design and infrastructure. Concretely, everyone in the group has the opportunity to volunteer as the discussion lead in a rotation fashion and choose a topic he/she is interested in to present.
